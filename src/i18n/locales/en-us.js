				description: `At EngagED S.A., I had the privilege of working on a new API from scratch with my team, where I undertook the challenge of developing and maintaining a serverless API for a white label education platform. During my tenure, I played a pivotal role in shaping the platform's core functionality, focusing on several key features:

				\u2022 Course and Class Management: Developed the foundational features for course and class management, including course creation, room allocation, chapter structuring, and lesson management.
				
				\u2022 Customizable Questionnaire: Designed and implemented a customizable questionnaire feature, offering a range of options for test creation and user progress assessment.
				
				\u2022 File Storage Integration: Integrated file storage functionality, enabling users to upload and manage course-related materials securely.
				
				\u2022 Enrollment System Optimization: Implemented an enrollment system, leveraging AWS SQS for streamlined data analytics and enhanced performance.
				
				\u2022 Certificate Builder: Developed a certificate builder tool that allows for the creation of personalized templates and offers various generation options based on student course progress or manual inputs.
				
				\u2022 Payment Implementations: Orchestrated the integration of payment solutions, facilitating invoice generation with payment links, scheduled payment functionalities, and checkout optimizations for improved conversions.
				
				Throughout my time at EngagED S.A., I had the privilege of learning from experienced colleagues who generously shared their knowledge and expertise. Their guidance and mentorship were invaluable in helping me navigate complex technical challenges and develop effective solutions.
				
				As I transitioned into the role of the sole backend developer, the skills and insights imparted by my mentors served as a solid foundation, empowering me to take on new responsibilities with confidence. Even in moments of autonomy, I never felt alone, knowing that I could rely on the support and expertise of my colleagues whenever needed.

				This collaborative learning environment not only accelerated my technical growth but also fostered a strong sense of teamwork and camaraderie. Together, we tackled ambitious projects, celebrated shared successes, and learned from each other's experiences, creating a culture of continuous learning and improvement.`,
