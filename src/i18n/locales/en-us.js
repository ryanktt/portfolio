					"An education platform for creating and managing online classes. Well, we've built the new API from scratch, so I was able to really grasp hard concepts from beginning to end and we've come a long way. The platform now offers an array of options, all of which I've worked on as a backend developer alongside my team, options such as course, room, lesson and student enrollment managing, content storage, questionnaire, a client friendly certificate builder with optional auto generation based on student progress, data import, punctual and recurrent payment, payment link, checkout processes, integrations such as facebook pixel, robust admin policy configuration and much more. I could not be more thankfull for this oportunity.",
